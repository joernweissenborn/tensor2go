operator concepts are useful

can  complex stuff be covered with inverters?

dod is a functional on a 2d vectorspace
also mus dod den tensor reduzieren

the add and multiply is non abelian, we do not have a body here (yet)

its fucking important to emphasize, that we construct maps here, so instea of calcing stuff, we make make a map of what needs to be calculcaltet

moreover, we gic the gice the maps structure, to enable tranformations, the same map in a different aspect

algebraic optimizers: go

make vector scalar prod out of multi dim tens contraction
oaber du wirst erst vector special machen muessen um den graphen approach zu raffen
